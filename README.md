# comp141-extra-credit-try2 notes:
- my apologies for not being able to name it just comp141-extra-credit, i messed up and had to rename my repo, so i didnt end up confusing myself. 
- i also did create a shell variable called TESTENV1 and set it to "test" but it cannot be seen in my output directory as it is not a file. 
- also, my process.txt file was saving the first 5 lines of ps command, and i was concerned that it was 4, but upon typing the ps command directly into the terminal, i was able to see that it was only 4 lines anyway.
