# comp141-extra-credit-try2
my apologies for not being able to name it just comp141-extra-credit, i messed up and had to rename my repo, so i didnt end up confusing myself. 
i also did create a shell variable called TESTENV1 and set it to "test" but it cannot be seen in my output directory as it is not a file.
